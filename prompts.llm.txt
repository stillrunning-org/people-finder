I have only this information, which might be misleading.

{"id":"http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q8249160","name":"Baochu","age":0,"birthDate":"","deathDate":"1900-01-01T00:00:00Z"}
{"batchcomplete":"","query":{"pages":{"1894197":{"pageid":1894197,"ns":0,"title":"\u8446\u521d","extract":"\u8446\u521d\uff081860\u5e74\u20141900\u5e74\uff09\u963f\u9c81\u7279\u6c0f\uff0c\u5b57\u6548\u5148\uff0c\u53f7\u51ac\u5fc3\uff0c\u6ee1\u6d32\u9576\u9ec4\u65d7\u4eba\uff0c\u6e05\u671d\u5916\u621a\u3001\u4e66\u6cd5\u5bb6\u3002"}}},"limits":{"extracts":20}}

Figure out who is the real historical figure behind it. Particularly, I need the age they had at the moment of dying. THIS IS THE MUST, THE NUMBER MUST BE IN THE ANSWER. If the exact number is not possible to determine (e.g. birth- or deathDate is not known),  you must use your best judgement, knowledge and any resources (including external) available to figure it out or calculate it, because the number MUST be calculated somehow.

Return back your thinking followed by a JSON with the following fields:
- "isRealHuman" (boolean, True/False, if a real human being that ever lived on Earth, not a fictional character, not an animal etc)
- "birthDate" (string in format YYYY-MM-DD, might be your estimate)
- "deathDate" (string in format YYYY-MM-DD,  might be your estimate),
- "ageAtDeath" (integer, might be your estimate),
- "shortDescriptionEn" (string, short description in English, must include 70% of general information and 30% about the circumstances of their death)
- "shortDescriptionFr" (string, short description in French, same as above)
- "shortDescriptionDe" (string, short description in German, same as above)
- "shortDescriptionEs" (string, short description in Spanish, same as above)
- "shortDescriptionRu" (string, short description in Russian, same as above)
- "confidence" (integer from 0 to 100, your confidence in the information provided, in percents)
